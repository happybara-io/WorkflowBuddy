# Slack Automation - WorkflowBuddy

Workflow Builder is great! Except it's got a very limited selection of built-in Slack triggers (shortcut, emoji reaction, new channel member, webhook) and VERY limited selection of built-in Slack actions (send a message, send a form). You can get creative and do a lot with these building blocks, but what if you want to do more?

ü•≥ ‚ú® **Ta-da!** ‚ú®

This Slack App acts as an extension of Workflow Builder, providing access to significantly more Slack triggers (such as `app_mention`, `channel_created`, etc.) and expanding the suite of actions available. The most important is the `webhook` functionality, which enables users to plug their Slack Workflow steps into almost any other application.

## üèÅüé¨ Available Triggers

All [Slack events](https://api.slack.com/events) proxied through to any **_webhook-triggered_** Workflows.\* See _"Templates to save time"_ for copyable webhook starting points.

_*While WorkflowBuddy code will work out of the box as an event proxy, you will need to update your app's OAuth scopes & event subscriptions for your new events, as well as save the webhook event from your Workflow in the config._

## üèÉAvailable Steps

The utilities currently available within WorkflowBuddy for use as Workflow Steps. To see the exact inputs & outputs without loading up Workflow Builder, see [constants.py](https://github.com/happybara-io/WorkflowBuddy/blob/main/constants.py)

### Send a Webhook

Send data from your Slack Workflows to almost any service. You can trigger GitHub repos, Jenkins Builds, Salesforce actions, you name it.

### Random Int

Generate a random int in the range [`lower_bound`-`upper_bound`], inclusive.

### Random UUID

Generate a random UUID with [Python's standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html).

### (Slack) Create a channel

This action will create a new channel with your specified name, then return the `channel_id` as both text & the `channel` type so it can be used in Slack's built-in functions.

### (Slack) Find user by email

Get a user based on their Slack email. Returns the user as both a text `user_id` and a `user` type so it can be used in Slack's built-in functions.

### More to come ....

Potential ideas seen in the wild for other automation use-cases ([Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/categories/zapier-tools) and [n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/) are good sources):
- Wait/delay state
  - Workflow Builder does not have a convenient way to add a pause step - Workflows are long-running, so it should be no problem to have some wait action that doesn't run `complete()` until the duration has passed. The best solution for this may vary by hosting provider, or by integrating with a 3rd-party service.
- Filter/conditional stop
  - If a certain condition is not met, stop the workflow. Handy if you only want it to fire on certain conditions and the trigger isn't granular enough.
- Send email and/or SMS
  - Might be hard if they want it sent from their own address vs a generic SendGrid-type account.
- Calendar invites/sending with a link?
  - This seems like it's mostly covered through the `Send a message` built-in.
- Suggested Slack actions based on Zapier
  - Add reminder
  - Invite user to channel
  - Send channel message (slack built-in)
  - Send direct message (slack built-in)
  - Create channel
  - Set channel topic (! Cannot be done with a Bot token, only user token üòî)
  - Update profile
  - Set status
  - Find message
  - find user by ID
  - Find user by name
  - Find user by username

## Deploying & running the app

TBD.

### Templates to save time

When using **Workflow Builder Webhooks**, it requires allow-listing any data keys you want to use from the request body. To make this easier, in `event_trigger_example_workflows/`, you can find templates that already have all the requisite keys already in place, matching the [core payload from the Slack API](https://api.slack.com/events?). Currently the wrapping payload is not included, but could be an easy contribution in the future.

## Development

- Create a `.env` file that looks like:
  ```
  SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-********
  SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=********
  ```
- `poetry install` (or install with your preferred Python tool using the `requirements.txt`)

## local dev
- `poetry shell` so all our environment variables are easy
- (in a separate terminal) Run `ngrok http 3000` to get a public domain address - [Ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com)
- Run the local server with `./run.sh`
- Update the Slack App console with new address - for [Event Subscriptions](https://api.slack.com/apps/A040W1RHGBX/event-subscriptions?), Interactivity - this is easiest done by updating the `slack_app_manifest.yml` file and then copying it onto the Manifest page in Slack App console.
- (_Testing Webhooks_) [Handy tool to debug with](https://webhook.site)

## How it works

For Slack events, this app basically just acts as a proxy. As long as the event is added to the bot's OAuth scopes, it should be able to proxy it through to your **Workflow Builder** flow. 

For the new actions, it registers a **Workflow Builder Step** - unfortunately each app is limited to 10 registered with Slack. To get around that limitation, we have the user select from a static select list of actions that have been implemented on the server, then update the modal to give them the appropriate options. For example, if the user wants to `Send a webhook`, we'll then update the modal to have an input for the Webhook URL, and a text box for the body they want to send.

Config data (basically just webhooks for now) is persisted on disk using [Python Shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html#module-shelve).

## Future Work

As you may have noticed, this is a P.o.C. There is no resiliency baked into this application yet, so don't throw anything mission critical on it yet. A non-exhaustive list of updates it would benefit from:

- Server needs to be productionized and easy to deploy - Docker-Compose is recommended route.
  - Write up a guide on how to deploy it to [Fly.io](https://fly.io) or similar easy deploy tools.
- Sending webhooks should have a simple retry mechanism in place, in case it just needs a few seconds before things work hunky dory.
- Incoming actions should be placed into a resilient queue, that way events aren't lost in the case of downstream failure response, server outage, or etc. 
  - A DB like SQlite can act as a queue in a pinch, so long as you setup an easy cron option. Rather than figuring out how to setup Celery with Python, why not use one of those services that will send you a webhook on a cron schedule, so all you have to write is an endpoint. [Cronhooks](https://cronhooks.io/) is one such aptly named service.
- Tracking the timestamps of when the workflows were kicked off and also whether they succeeded or failed would be a nice touch, but that's a lot of data for a PoC app.
