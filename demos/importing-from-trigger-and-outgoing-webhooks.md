# Importing Event Trigger Templates and Outgoing Webhooks Demo

This demo will teach you:
- Importing from the [`event_trigger_example_workflows/`](https://github.com/happybara-io/WorkflowBuddy/tree/main/event_trigger_example_workflows).
- Adding new Event->Webhook mappings in the App Home.
- Triggering a Workflow with a custom Slack event.
- Proxying Slack events to a URL you manage (in the demo, [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site), but could be Zapier, a custom server, etc).
- Using the `Outgoing Webhook` Step action to send data from your Slack workspace/Workflows to another service (Examples at top of mind would be Jira, GitHub, Asana, etc).
