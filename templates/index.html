    <h3>What is Workflow Buddy?</h3>
    <p>Workflow Buddy fills the gaps we've seen in Workflow Builder functionality. This includes:    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>an HTTP Request/Outgoing Webhook Step</li>
        <li>Debug Mode while working on your workflows</li>
        <li>failure notifications if a Buddy Step fails</li>
        <li>.... and much more - refer back to the <a href="https://github.com/happybara-io/WorkflowBuddy">docs</a> if you are interested in more info.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Self-hosted vs Hosted/Cloud</h3>
    <p>The core difference at the present between self-hosted and cloud is level of support. We will of course fix bugs and respond to issues on the repo, but hosted users can expect faster responses and quicker resolutions to their issues.
        Self-hosting also opens the door for unique deployment/infra issues we aren't equipped to help with.</p>
    <h3>Where is data stored?</h3>
    <p>
        The vast majority of data involved in Workflows (especially the configuration forms you see in Workflow Builder) are all stored on Slack's servers, Workflow Buddy just acts as an intermediary when they
        are running.

        The data Buddy stores is limited to what is needed for functionality (encrypted OAuth tokens, Slack team/user IDs, etc.), or is useful for your own team's stats (such as usage of Step types). If you are curious
        to know more detail, check out the <em>"buddy/db.py"</em> file in the open-source repo, which shows all the database models. You can also <a href="mailto:support@happybara.io">email Happybara Support</a>
